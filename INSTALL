DOWNLOAD

  There are two ways to download the source code.

  A. The tarball, which contains SpiderMonkey

    1. Fetch the jsext-{version}.tar.gz file.

    2. Type `tar xvzf jsext-{version}.tar.gz'

  B. The SVN source, which does not contain SpiderMonkey

    1. Run SVN checkout
       svn checkout 'https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jsext/jsext/trunk/'

    2. Type `cd trunk' to enter the directory containing the source.

    3. Fetch the latest SpiderMonkey tarball.
       wget 'ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/js-{version}.tar.gz'

    4. type `tar xvzf js-{version}.tar.gz'

    5. Fetch the latest nspr zip file.
       wget 'ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/nspr/r{version}/nspr{version}.zip'

    6. type 'unzip nspr{version}.zip'

    7. type 'mv mozilla/nsprpub .'

LINUX INSTALL:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. This step usually requires root access.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.


WINDOWS INSTALL:

  Unless you need the latest bleeding-edge version of jsext or you are
  planning to contribute to the low-level side of jsext, you should
  consider downloading a binary distribution.

  1. Install Visual Studio C++ in its default locaton. The express
     edition (free download from Microsoft) will do.

  2. Install the Platform SDK (free download from Microsoft) in its
     default location.

  3. Open the file js\src\js.mak and locate the first mention of
     LINK32_FLAGS. Add /opt:noicf to the end of the list. Here's why:

       http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/release-notes/NOICF.html

  4. Download gmake for windows, for instance from this project:

       http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=9328

  4. Open a command prompt with the VC++ environment variables set
     (there is a shortcut for that purpose in the start menu). `cd'
     to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `build.bat'

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `clean.bat'.
