    script = load(filename [, before [, after]])

Loads and compiles a JavaScript file. Returns the value of the last expression in the script.
The file may start with a "shebang" line, which is ignored.
If the parameters 'before' and 'after' are given and are
strings, they are added before and after the contents of
the file before it is interpreted.

The file should use the ISO-8859-1 character set (or ASCII, which is a subset of ISO-8859-1).
