    t = Type.struct(member0, member1, ...)

Creates a new [[Type]] object representing a _struct_. The member arguments
should be objects containing two properties: _name_ and _type_. The
_type_ property should be a Type object.

Types created with this function have read-only properties with the same
names as the members, containing the argument objects passed to this
function. These objects are augmented with read-only properties _offset_
and _index_. Also, struct types have read-only properties named 0 through
_n_, which point to the same objects.
