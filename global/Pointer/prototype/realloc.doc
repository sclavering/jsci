realloc(bytes)
---


Changes the size of a memory area allocated with [[Pointer.malloc]], [[Pointer.calloc]] or the [[Pointer]] allocation constructor.
The contents of the memory block is left unchanged even if it needs to be moved to another location. Newly allocated
memory is uninitialized. The memory is freed when the
pointer object is garbage collected.
