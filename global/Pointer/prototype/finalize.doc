finalize
---


You may assign a _finalize' property to any pointer. This should be an imported
native function to be called when the pointer object is garbage collected. The
function will be passed the pointer as its only argument.

NOTE
---


The _finalize_ function must be a function taking exactly one non-const pointer argument.
Any type of pointer is acceptable as the argument type.
Any return value type is acceptable, the return value will be ignored.

NOTE 2
---


Assigning a finalize function to a pointer forces the _function pointer_
to be resolved at the time of assignment, possibly causing a
ReferenceError to be thrown.

NOTE 3
---


The finalize property is write-only and always returns _undefined_ if you
attempt to read it. To delete it, assign _undefined_ to it.

    pointer.finalize = undefined;  // removes finalization function

    delete pointer.finalize; // has no effect.
