calloc(bytes)
---


Creates a new [[Pointer]] of type _void_ which points to a newly allocated
memory area. The memory is initialized to zero. The memory is freed when the
pointer object is garbage collected.

Freeing the pointer returned from Pointer.calloc (i.e. with clib.free) is an error, and will result
in a segmentation fault.

Not freeing a pointer returned from clib.calloc is an error, and will result in memory leakage.
