finalize
---


Every pointer has a write-only property named finalize. This is a pointer to a native function which will
be called then the pointer is finalized during garbage collection. The native function will be
called with one argument: The pointer which is being finalized. It is not possible to execute
JavaScript code during finalization.

Set finalize to _undefined_ or _null_ in order to disable the finalizer. No finalizer is
set by default.

Example

this.fp=clib.fopen("/tmp/myfile.txt","r");
this.fp.finalize=clib.fclose;
delete this.fp; // Remove the only reference to fp.
JSEXT.GC(); // Garbage collection closes the file.
