    obj = new ActiveCdb( filename )

An ActiveCdb object is an object whose properties are stored in
a [[$curdir.Cdb]] file. A Cdb file consists of key/value pairs.
Keys correspond to property names and values should be
strings containing JavaScript source code. Whatever value this
source code evaluates to becomes
the value of the corresponding property of _obj_.
ActiveCdb uses _lazy evaluation_, i.e. the values are not
evaluated before the corresponding property is _read_ for the first
time. Writing to an ActiveCdb object does not alter the underlying
file.

Evaluation context
---

The expressions in the Cdb file are evaluated as scripts, so they
may contain an expression, a statement or more than one statement.
The value of the corresponding property is the value of the last
statement. The 'this' object refers to _obj_ (the ActiveCdb instance).
