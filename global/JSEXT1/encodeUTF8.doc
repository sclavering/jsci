    encodeUTF8 (str [, modified])

The encodeUTF8 function computes a new version of a string in which each instance of certain
characters is replaced by one, two or three 8-bit characters representing the 16-bit input
character.

If the optional _modified_ argument is given and is _true_, any zero characters in the
input string are encoded as 0xc0 0x80 to avoid zero characters in the output string. No such
flag is necessary for the UTF8 decoder, since the regular decoding algorithm will
decode 0xc0 0x80 to the zero character.
