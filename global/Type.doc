Type Objects
---

Type objects represent C types, used for calling native functions in
dynamic libraries.

The Type Constructor
---

The type constructor can not be called directly. Instead, use
the predefined types [[Type.int]], [[Type.char]] etc. or the
functions [[Type.pointer]], [[Type.array]], [[Type.function]], [[Type.struct]] or [[Type.union]],
which create new types.
