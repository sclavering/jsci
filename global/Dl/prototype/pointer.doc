    obj.pointer(symbol, type)

Creates and returns a new pointer.

* _symbol_: [[String]] containing the name the object within the dynamic library. On Windows, the
symbol may also be a [[Number]] containing the object's ordinal value. If the symbol
is a string, it has to match the regexp /^[a-zA-Z\_][a-zA-Z\_0-9@]*$/.
* _type_: A [[Type]] object.

NOTE
---

The symbol is not actually resolved until the first time the pointer is dereferenced.
Function pointers are not resolved until the they are dereferenced and called for
the first time. If the symbol
is not found, a [[ReferenceError]] will be thrown at that time.
