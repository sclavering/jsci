The Dl Constructor Called as a Function
---

When Dl is called as a function rather than as a constructor, it creates
and initialises a new dl object. Thus the function call Dl(...)
is equivalent to the object creation expression new Dl(...) with
the same arguments.

When Pointer is called as part of a new expression, it is a constructor:
it initialises the newly created object.

    new Dl (filename)

The filename refers to the dynamic library to open. On Linux, these are
known as .so files, and on Windows, they are .dll files.

On all operating systems, the filename may or may not contain a path. If
it does contain a path, the library will be loaded from that location.
Otherwise, the library will be searched for in a search path which depends
on the operating system.

If _filename_ is omitted, undefined or null, the returned Dl represents
the jsext main executable.
