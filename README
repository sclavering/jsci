This is jsext:

* A set of native Spidermonkey objects for interacting with the host.
* A library, libjsext, which initializes these objects.
* A command-line program which gives access to Spidermonkey and the jsext modules

The purpose of the project is to facilitate the use of JavaScript as an
interface language between different pre-existing resources.

==Embedding JavaScript in C==

Jsext is based on Spidermonkey, Mozilla's JavaScript interpreter, which is
written in C. This interpreter is available as a separate component which
is easy to embed in a C program. A guide exists on how to do this:

http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/JavaScript_C_Engine_Embedder's_Guide

A program which embeds SpiderMonkey can use the jsext modules simply by
calling the initialization function in libjsext.

==Embedding C in JavaScript==

Jsext can parse C header files and call functions in dynamic libraries, i.e.
dlls on Windows and so files on Linux.

==Getting jsext==

The lastest release of jsext can be found at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsext

The tar file distributables contain the latest version of SpiderMonkey without modifications.
If you download the CVS repository, you need to fetch SpiderMonkey and untar it in the jsext
root directory (the one where this file is).

==Making deb package==

Run dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot in this directory. For rpm-package, fakeroot alien -r ../<...>.deb
